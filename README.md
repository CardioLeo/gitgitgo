# Description: A bash script that runs the boilerplate git init commands.
# Usage: gitgitgo
#
#
# Read This First:
#
# I haven't got this script to the point where it runs all the commands which
# github recommends for "creating a new repository on the command line."
# You have to run a command that is commented out below in the script.
# Specifcally, you have to run line 6 yourself after filling out line 6
# with the correct information of the repo you want to push up to on github.
# Line 7, which will actually push up the code, would run an error message
# without that correct information in line 6. So until I can write an
# appropriate conditional for the script I have commented line 7 out as well.
#
# 
# Tips for Beginners:
# 
# First, you will want to change the permissions of this script
# by running the command "sudo chmod 744 gitgitgo". Otherwise,
# it won't run.
#
# Second, you will want to place this script in a directory
# that your "~/.profile" will refer to for bash scripts.
# You may have to look this up for your particular distro.
#
# Third, you may actually just want to run this script for times
# when you will have a number of repos to initalize all at once or
# when you will have to do a number in a row, one after another.
# If you don't have bulk needs at the moment, keep in mind
# that there is value in the repetition and muscle memory,
# in the familiarity with meanings, syntax, semantic and logic of commands -
# value that we can miss when we use a script like this too often.
# But perhaps this is only a note for a beginner. (Or is it?)
